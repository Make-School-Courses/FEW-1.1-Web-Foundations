# JavaScript Browser API project

The goal of the Browser API project is to create an example project that illustrates the usage of one of the browser APIs. You can choose any API you like as long as it is supported by a browser. 

Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs. This project should be *small*. It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo. 

**NOTE!** You should choose a browser API, not a web service. Your API should be something provided by the browser. **For example** Canvas is okay, Yelp is not. 

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows **three features** of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and **include a Readme**. The Readme should include:
    - An overview of the API and the features your project demonstrates. Include the following: 
      - It's uses and features
      - Notes on browser support
      - Your opinions and experiences:
        - Do you think this is a good feature
        - How do you think it will be used
        - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
    - How to run the demo
    - Links to: 
      - Documentation
      - Other resources
  - **Stretch goal:** Write a Medium post about your experience with your chosen API. This article should be at least 500 words. If you do the stretch goal post a link to your article in your Github Repo.
