# FEW 1.1 - Giphy Network Project

## Description 

This project is a short assignment that will give you an opportunity to practice making network requests with JS. 

### Why this assignment?

Loading data over the internet is a common operation and one that comes up often at job interviews. You should have this skill in your tool belt. 

## Project requirements

The goal of this project is to re-create the [Giphy search page](https://giphy.com/search/cats) with JS. You'll make a single HTML document and write JS that will send a search term to Giphy and load images based on that term. 

Follow the code samples from [Lesson 9](../lessons/lesson-09.md).
