# FEW 1.1 - Final Project

## Description 

Your final project will be a platform for you to combine and practice all of the material covered in class this term.

### Why this assignment?

This assignment will give you a chance to revisit and solidify your understanding of what was covered this term. It will also give you the opportunity to create a portfolio worthy project. 

## Project requirements

Your final project should take all of the ideas from class and put them together.

Your final project should incorporate everything listed below. 

- HTML - Use semantic HTML
- CSS - 
  - Typographic styles 
  - Flex Box 
  - CSS Grid
- JavaScript 
  - Variables and Functions 
  - JS and DOM
  - Event Listeners

This may sound like a lot at first. Looking back on the tutorials realize any one of the tutorials contain a majority of items on the list. 

Here are a few suggestions to get started: 

- Single Page site + Slide Show + JS Quiz - This combines everything above into one web page. 
- JS Quiz + Slide Show - Imagine each quiz question on a slide and the questions slide one to the next as you answer them.
- Expanding on one of the tutorials to include items from the list above. 

I encourage your creative solutions. 

Remember the goal is to make something interesting that you would be proud to show. The work in your portfolio is what will get you noticed and invited to interviews.
