### Why this assignment?

This assignment will give you a chance to revisit and solidify your understanding of what has covered this term. It will also allow you to **create a portfolio worthy project.**

## Project requirements

Your final project should take all of the ideas from class and put them together.

Your final project should incorporate everything listed below. 

- HTML - Use semantic HTML
- CSS - 
 - Typographic styles 
 - Flex Box 
 - CSS Grid
- JavaScript 
 - Variables and Functions 
 - JS and DOM
 - Event Listeners

This may sound like a lot at first but you can borrow ideas and code snippets from the class examples.

## Content and Subject for Final

The content and subject for your final should come from one of your S & L classes. Try and get credit for your work with your S & L instructor. You could even coordinate the idea with them.

You'll need text and pictures. Text can come from your S & L reading and homework. You may also want to research the subject. 

Images you can take yourself or find through search. 

## Ideas 

Make a single page site. This should be one web page with content that is revealed as youscroll down the page.

Parallax Scrolling effect. Take a look at the example below. These show how to implement a parallax scrolling effect with a minimum of CSS.

Animation on Scroll. This is an effect when elements on the page animate when the page scrolls into view.

## Layout

Thikn of a single page site as a stack of boxes. Think of each box in this stack as it's own "page." Each of these sections can have their own layout. One section could be arranged as a grid, while another could use flex box. 

**You should be using Flexbox for more of your layout.**

Take a look at this wire frame for a single page site.
