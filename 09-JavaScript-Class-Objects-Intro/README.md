# JavaScript Class Objects and Prototype

While JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming Language
it handles Class Objects and Inheritence differently than 
other languages. Understanding JavaScript's unique 
inheritence model is key to fully understanding JavaScript.

In this lesson you will take a look at how to create class 
objects with JavaScript and how to use prototype. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Define Classes that create Objects with JS
1. Use the Prototype chain generate objects
1. Use ES6 class syntax to generate instances
1. Use Element reference to manipulate the DOM 

## Initial Exercise

Read this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes

- What is prototype? 
  - Using Prototype

## In Class Example 

- Make an Object
  - Add properties 
  - and methods
- Make an class with a function
  - Add properties 
  - Add methods 
    - Use prototype 
- Define a class ES6 style
  - Use the constructor 
  - Add properties 
  - Add methods

The examples below can be done on Repl.it [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/2ojb5qc)

## Example 0 - Objects and this

Understanding this in JS is important. This can often be confusing. 
We will with the basic concepts here. 

[Challenge 1](challenge-0)

## Example 1 - Objects and Prototype

The goal of this challenge is to define Class Objects in JS. 
This process uses the prototype property. 

[Challenge 1](challenge-1)

## Example 2 - Classes 

JS provides a class syntax for creating objects. This syntax 
provides a new sytax for creating the same types of objects 
cr4eated with prototype!

The class syntax has a couple differences. These are all just 
cosmetic.

## Example 3 - Challenge!

This exampe has an array of data. Your goal is to display it
all on the page. To keep things organized you'd like to make 
an Object to store each item in data.js. 

The data describes 1000 users. Should make an Object that 
describes a user.

## After Class

- Complete the Cookie clicker tutorial
- Complete challenges
- Complete the reading below
- Apply these ideas to your personal website. 
  - Identify the data displayed by your site. 
  - Store it in an Object, or Array
  - Use the ideas from class 8 and 9 to render HTML content to your page with JS
