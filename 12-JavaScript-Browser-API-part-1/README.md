## In Class Activity I

- What are the limitations to applications that run in a web browser? 
- What are the advantages of applications that run in a web browser?

## After Class

Your goal is to make a project that tests one of the browser APIs. This project should be small. It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. 

NOTE! You should a browser API not a web service. Your API should be something provided by a web service. For example: Canvas is okay, Yelp is not. 

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows three features of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and include a readme
  - Stretch goal: Write a Medium post about your experience with your chosen API
