# Personal Homepage Project

The goal of this project is create your own 
personal homepage. This can be anything you 
envision. 

Try to limit yourself to only frontend. You 
can add backend features in the future. This 
class is focussed on frontend. ideally this 
would be a playground or platoform where you 
can practice the material from class. 

You will have time to work this project in 
class. You can also work on it outside of 
class. 

## What is your personal homepage?

This is a platform to be your presence on 
the internet. 

- Information about you
- Experimental lab
  - show your CSS and JS experiments
- Links and descriptions for your projects
- Blog 
- CS code samples and experiments
- Anything else you can think of...

This can any project you want it to be. 
Keeping some limits will allow you to get 
more out of the project. 

The class is focussed on frontend. Limit 
yourself to only frontend features. Keep 
in mind you can expand the project in the 
future.
