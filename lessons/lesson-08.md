# FEW 1.1 - Lesson 8 - JS Intro Arrays

<!-- Put a link to the slides so that students can find them -->

➡️ [**Slides**](/Syllabus-Template/Slides/Lesson1.html ':ignore')

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

- Define arrays 
- Use Arrays in JS Application
- Create arrays from DOM elements

## Why learn this? 

Arrays are a core feature of all languages. Arrays are used to manage lists of things. Programs would be very limited without arrays. Expect every app to use arrays in some form.

## Debugging: Console.log()

Use `console.log(value)` test everything. 

When something doesn't work it's often due to value that is wrong, or is not what you think it. A first to debugging is to identify suspect values and look at them.

## Make a Tip calculator

**Pair** up and make a tip calculator. 

Copy the template below into a text file and save it with the .html extension. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <style>
      /* Put your styles here */

    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div class="container">
      <form id="tip-calculator">
        <label>
          Bill
          <input id="bill-total" type="number" step="0.1">
        </label>
        
        <label>
          Tip %
          <input id="tip-percent" type="number" step="0.1">
        </label>
        
        <div id="tip">0.00</div>
      </form>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Your scripts here

      // Get references to elements 


      // Event handlers 


      // Functions 

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Stretch goal: publish your tip calculator as a GitHub Page.
