## Completing your Final project

You have one week to finish your final project. You may not be able to do everything you want to do in that time. While you can continue to work on your project after the term is complete, and I hope that you will, for now you should decide what work will make the most impact. 

Identify three things that will make your project: 

- Work without error or unexpected results?
- What will make your project finished and complete?
- What is the most important feature that needs to be completed?

Break the tasks above into smaller tasks. Estimate the time they will take. If a task would take more than 2 or 3 hours break it into several subtasks. 

Look at your list and identify three tasks you can do today in class now!

## JS Carousel

Bootstrap has this great Carousel. This is good for some projects. It can be used in many different situations. While the content can be pictures it can also be other HTML. 

Have you ever though about what goes into making the carousel? Here is a video tutorial series that covers this: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV1WbQdusdU&list=PLoN_ejT35AEgjsI-YEuiif2BfpToamnGz

You can follow the tutorial and build the code yourself from scratch. Take a look at the GitHub repo to see the finished project and notes.

See a demo of the slidehow carousel here:

If you don't want to build the carousel yourself you can just use it or modify the existing code.
