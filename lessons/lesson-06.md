## Responsive Design 

Responsive design is design that responds to it's environment. Web sites are often viewed on mobile devices. Giving your sites the ability to adapt to the environement is like giving them a super power. 

<!-- > -->

## Objectives 

- Identify the differences between mobile and desktop
- Design for Mobile and Desktop
- Use Media queries to adapt your layouts for mobile

<!-- > -->

## What's the difference?

What are the differences between mobile and desktop? 

Pair and discuss...

<!-- > -->

### The Differences

- Screen size
- Pixel denisity/size
- Interaction touch vs cursor

Google for screen mobile screen sizes....

What did you find?

<!-- > -->

## Screen Sizes

The number of mobile screens is bewildering. 

<!-- > -->

## Viewport 

When making a mobile site you the developer can configure the viewport. 

Mobile devices by default assume that a web site is configured for desktop assuming the size of the screen 960px wide. In this case you as a viewer would have to pinch, zoom, and scroll around to view the page. 

<!-- > -->

When making a mobile site configuring the viewport to size of the device is a good idea. 

```html
<meta 
  name='viewport' 
  content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0' 
/>
```

What does this do? 

<!-- > -->

Sets the viewport options in the browser for this web page. 

- width of the page matches the width of the device
- Initial scale should 100%
- Max scale should be 100%

Result: page renders to the size of the screen and it doesn't scale. 

<!-- > -->

## Testing Mobile 

There are a couple ways to test your sites on mobile. 

- Emulate a mobile screen in your browser. 
  - Safari: 
    - Turn on developer mode in Safari > Preferences > Advanced Check "Show Develop menu"
  - Chrome: OPen the inspector and click the Mobile icon in the upper left. 
- Publish to GitHub and test on a mobile device.

## Media Queries 

The next step is to apply styles based on the screen size. 

CSS works with a set of media queries. These allow you to target styles based the environment. 

Take a look at what the documentation says: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries

<!-- > -->

What did you see here? make a list. 

<!-- > -->

## Using Media Queries

In a broad sense you can target CSS styles to media: print, screen, or speech. 

Use one of two methods: 

<!-- > -->

Target all rules in a stylesheet at a media category. 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="print">`

<!-- > -->

In a stylesheet target rules at media: 

```CSS
@media print {
  body {
    color: black;
  }
  ...
}
```

<!-- > -->

## Break points 

Targeting different media types like print or screen is easy and the difference is obvious. When targeting phones, tablets, and other computers the differences are harder to identify. 

<!-- > -->

Common practice is to look at the screen size and target screens in categories.

### Responsive design

When designing a responsive site you'll need think about how elements on the screen will appear on a screen of a different size. 

<!-- > -->

Take a look at these images and ask yourself what changes?

- In some cases nothing changes
- Boxes stretch or shrink
- Images and text change size
- Number of columns change
- Layout chnages

### Using Break Points

**Challenge** 

Have a game plan. Use your design document, created in Sketch, XD or Figma redraw your site sized for mobile 320px wide. 

All content should remain, it should only be moved and resized. 

**Stretch**

Make a tablet sized layout 768px wide.

<!-- > -->

Start working on your web site. Add the meta tag to the head of your html document. 

```html
<meta 
  name='viewport' 
  content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0' 
/>
```

<!-- > -->

Add these media queries to your stylesheet. 

```CSS
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {

} 

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {

} 

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {

} 

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {

} 

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {

}
```

You may not use all of these. Start with the first media query (extra small screens) and redefine your grid. This will be different for everyone but might look something like: 

```CSS
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .wrapper {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 100px;
    grid-template-areas:  "h h h h" /* Rearrange the grid*/
                          "r r r r"
                          "s s s s"
                          "m m m m"
                          "g g g g" 
                          "f f f f";
  }
} 
```

<!-- > -->

After getting the layout figured out work yopur way through your document from the "big" things to small things. Decide what styles need to change at each of the break points.
