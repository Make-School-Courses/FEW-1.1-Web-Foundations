## Dicussion: Functions and Scope

<!-- > -->

### Functions 

Here is some information about functions:

- Functions are objects
- Functions are first class values
- Functions expression vs declarations 
- Parameters
  - default values
- Return values

<!-- > -->

### Scope 

Scope determines where a variable can be accessed

- Block vs function scope
- const, let, var

<!-- > -->

## Looking for Scope

Examine the Slide Show code and find the following: 

- const, let, and var
  - Name the scope for each variable and function
- functions
  - Identify all functions 
  - Identify closure

## In Class Challenges

Take a look at your slide show. It could be improved. Try these challenges. 

- Currently the slide uses images as "slides". It would be more useful if the slide show could use any content for a "slide".
- It would be good to have a next and previous button to advance or retreat to a slide. Consider these issues: 
  - Should buttons be added in markup or should they be added dynamically?
    - If they are added dynamically could you use a data attribute to determine if buttons should be shown? 
    - When advancing to a slide should the time reset?
- Visual indicators would be. Add some idicators one for each slide. 
  - Highlight the indicator for the current slide. 
  - Use a data attribute to show the indicators.
  - Clicking an indicator advances to that slide.
