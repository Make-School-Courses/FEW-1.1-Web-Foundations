# JavaScript Functions and Variables 

JavaScript is the language of the browser. Use it to create 
complex user interactions, and manage data. JavaScript 
has many of the fearures found in other languages and some 
features unique to itself.

1. Define Variables with JavaScript
1. Invoke functions
1. Use functions

## Introduction

The original purpose of JavaScript was to script 
browsers. With JavaScript you can control almost all 
of the features and functions of the browser. 

Originally JavaScript was developed by Netscape for their 
browser and called LiveScript. The name was soon changed to 
JavaScript because Java was a new and popular language and 
Netscape thought this would be good for marketing.

While Java and JavaScript share the first 4 letters they 
are completely unrelated otherwise. 

## Where is JavaScript used? 

Everywhere. Seriously. Use JavaScript to: 

- Build web pages
  - Manipulate the DOM
  - Add interactivity
  - Create web apps 
- Script the server
  - JavaScript can run your server
  - Handle server API requests
- Embeded systems
  - Use JavaScript to program hardware devices
- Native applications
  - Script native applications 
  - Build native applications

## Where does it live?

JavaScript is plain text. It can be written in files with 
the .js extension or written into .html files.

Use the script tag to include JavaScript with a web page. 

```
<script>
  // Some JavaScript here...
  const message = 'hello world';
</Script>
```

Or link to a JavaScript in a .js file like this: 

```
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

In `main.js` you would write JavaScript without the script tag. 

```
// Some JavaScript
const foo = 'bar';
```
