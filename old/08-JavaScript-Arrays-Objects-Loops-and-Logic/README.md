# JavaScript Arrays, Objects, and Loops

Arrays, Objects are core data structures in JavaScript. 
Use them to hold and organize data used in the programs you write. 

Use loops to automate repetitive tasks. 

Hoisting, const, let, var

## Learning Objectives

1. Variables and scope
1. Define Arrays and Objects
1. Access values stored in arrays and Objects
1. Use loops to automate processes working with arrays and objects
1. Work with nested data structures

## Concepts in JavaScript

The concepts below are important to JavaScript.
Read and discuss. Think of short snippet of sample code that can explain the concept. 

- Variables can be declared with const, let, and var
  - var: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
    - Now think of an example that explains var
  - cosnt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
    - Think of an example that explains const
  - let: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
    - Think of an example that explains let
- Hoisting: Quick! you need to Read this! 
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting
  - Now think of an example that explains hoisting
- Scope
  - Block Scope
  - Function Scope

## Practical JavaScript

The goal of this section is to create a practical example using JS. 
The example will be a portfolio web site. The portfolio will display a list of projects you have created. If you haven't created too many projects, it can be a list of projects you plan on creating. 

### Overview 

The goal is to first define an object that contains data you want to
display on a page. 

The goal is to display a range of information, which will include: 

- text
- image
- date 

The system should generate semantic markup with class names. 

The last step will be to style the dynamically generated content. 

The [example](example) folder contains: 

- index.html
- main.js
- images (a folder)

main.js contains comments describing a rough outline of steps to follow. 

## After Class

Build a portfolio web site using the concept from class. 

- Replace the information with information describing your projects
- Add new properties to the data object
- Define an array of portfolio objects and display them all
- Use CSS to style and arrange the portfolio items on the screen
