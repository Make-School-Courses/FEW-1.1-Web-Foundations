# JavaScript Class Objects and Protypical Inheritence

While JavaScript is a Object Oriented Programming Language
it handles Class Objects and Inheritence differently than 
other languages. Understanding JavaScript's unique 
inheritence model is key to fully understanding JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Define Classes that create Objects with JS
1. Use the Prototype chain generate objects
1. Use ES6 class syntax to generate instances
1. Use Element reference to manipulate the DOM 

## Initial Exercise

- Make an Object with a function
  - Add properties 
  - Add methods 
    - Use prototype 
- Define a class ES6 style
  - Use the constructor 
  - Add properties 
  - Add methods 

## Overview 

- Why use Objects? 
- What is an Object?

## In Class Activity I

- Make an object that represents...
  - A User
  - A Car
  - A cat
- Let's try that again
  - Make an Object that represents an RPG character
