# Class 10 Challenges

You'll be making a single page that renders data via JS. Like the last set of challenges, this time you will make up the data to display yourself. 

You can take one of two approaches. 

1. Generate random data and display that data in a page.
2. Generate data yourself that represents data for a site you are creating. This could be:
  - Information that describes the content of your personal site. Data might describe each project in your site. 
  
## Challenge 0 

Think about what you want to make and what kind of data will describe it. 
You can use your personal website. In this case each piece of data might 
be a decsription of a project you have created with a title, description, links
to a live project, GitHub source, date created, etc. 

It could be something else. You can also mock up a random data set to use. 

## Challenge 1 

1. Make some data. Write your data into a JS file: `data.js`. 
2. Make an array of Objects and assign it to a global variable. 
3. Import `data.js` with the script tag. Make sure this is before your other scripts.

## Challenge 2 

This time you will want to store your data in a better structure. Create a Class that defines each of the elements in your data array. Loop through all of the data and make a new instance of your class for each item. Save each item in an array. 

From here you will use this array of objects to work with and display your data. 

You will also be able to add helper methods to make your work more organized. 

Imagine that what is in `data.js` is from an API or other service. You want to 
build this into a better structure used by your front end code. 

## Challenge 3 

Use the data from your data structure to display the information in the browser. You will need to generate blocks of HTML.
