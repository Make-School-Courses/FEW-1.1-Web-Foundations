# JavaScript API

Modern browsers are very sophisticated applications that are almost an operating system to themselves. All of this funcitonality is accessible through JavaScript. 

People are making advanced and highly functional applications that run in the browser. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Name and idenitify JavaScript APIs in the browser
1. Explore and identify upcoming technologies available in the browser
1. Measure browser support for any feature

## Initial Exercise

This a list of browser APIs that I compiled. It's not in any kind of order. Some of the APIs below are well established and in use today, some are in experiemental status and may be in full use or be replaced in the future. For this assignment you can use any of these or others you might discover that are not on this list. 

The first half of the list covers as many JavaScript based APIs as I could find. The second half of the list covers CSS features. You can use either. If it's something we covered in class I expect you to go beyond what was covered in class!

You are not limited to this list. You can choose other browser features that you might discover. The only requirement is that the feature/API you choose is one that is implemented in the browser!

For APIs that are experimental be sure to look up their support and include this as part of your assignment. 

- Gauge browser support: https://caniuse.com 

"Can I Use" has a lot of features. You can gauge support by browser, region, device etc. It also shows historical data. Be sure to mine this for your feature and include as much of this as you find relavant. 

## Overview

The browser API determines what you can do with the browser. There are many amazing apps that run in the browser.  Below is a short list of applications that run in the browser and make use of new features or push the standard features to their limit.

## In Class Activity I

- Discussion
  - What are the limitations of applications that run in a web browser? 
  - What are the advantages of applications that run in a web browser?

## After Class

Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs. This project should be *small*. It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo. 

**NOTE!** You should choose a browser API not a web service. Your API should be something provided by the browser. **For example:** Canvas is okay, Yelp is not. 

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows **three features** of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and **include a Readme**. The Readme should include:
    - An overview of the API and the features your project demonstrates. Include the following: 
      - It's uses and features
      - Notes on browser support
      - Your opinions and experiences:
        - Do you think this is a good feature
        - How do you think it will be used
        - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
    - How to run the demo
    - Links to: 
      - Documentation
      - Other resources
  - **Stretch goal:** Write a Medium post about your experience with your chosen API. This article should be atleast 500 words. If you do the stretch goal post a link to your article in your Githup Repo.
