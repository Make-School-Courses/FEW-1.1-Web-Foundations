# JavaScript API

Modern browsers are very sophisticated applications that are almost an operating system to themselves. All of this funcitonality is accessible through JavaScript. 

People are making advanced and highly functional applications that run in the browser. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Name and idenitify JavaScript APIs in the browser
1. Explore and identify upcoming technologies available in the browser
1. Measure browser support for any feature

## Initial Exercise

- Explore the browser APIs

- Gauge browser support: https://caniuse.com 
  - It's okay to choose a new or experiemental feature for this project. If you do, be sure to include information on support for your feature. 

## Overview

The browser API determines what you can do with the browser. There are many amazing apps that run in the browser.

## In Class Activity I

- Discussion
  - What are the limitations of applications that run in a web browser? 
  - What are the advantages of applications that run in a web browser?

## After Class

Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs. This project should be *small*. It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo. 

**NOTE!** You should choose a browser API not a web service. Your API should be something provided by the browser. **For example:** Canvas is okay, Yelp is not. 

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows three features of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and **include a readme**. The readme should include:
    - An overview of the API and the features your project demonstrates. Include the following: 
      - It's uses and features
      - Notes on browser support
      - Your opinions and experiences:
        - Do you think this is a good feature
        - How do you think it will be used
        - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
    - How to run the demo
    - Links to: 
      - Documentation
      - Other resources
  - Stretch goal: Write a Medium post about your experience with your chosen API. This article should be atleast 500 words.
