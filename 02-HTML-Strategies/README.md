# HTML Strategies

HTML is a language of structure, as such it's open to 
interpretation. You can decide the structure you want to 
create. While writing HTML with the correct 
syntax will always work, writing HTML with a strategy 
will make your work look more profesional, allow your 
work to interface with the world
through improved search and other processes. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

## Exercise 2 - Marking up images

Wow images are popular your web site needs them! Quick read these: 

- [img](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)
- [figure](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figure.asp)
- [figcaption](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp)

Hey that was all pretty techincal, I want some opinions:
