# HTML Strategies

HTML is a language of structure, as such it's open to 
interpretation. You can decide the structure you want to 
create. While writing HTML with the correct 
syntax will always work, writing HTML with a strategy 
will make your work look more profesional, allow your 
work to interface with the world
through improved search and other processes. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Use organizational elements
1. Markup documents with sectional tags
1. Identify the level of support for an element
1. Use the validator to find problems and solve them
1. Use form elements to markup forms
1. Identify and use HTML entities

## Exercise 1 - Whitespace and Special characters

**Challenge 1**: Markup the example text. This text includes computer code that inlcudes special characters and formatting. 

**Discussion**: 

- HTML Whitespace
  - Preformatted Text (pre tag)
- Special Characters (HTML entities)
- Code samples (code tag)

## Exercise 2 - Marking up images

Wow images are popular your web site needs them! Quick read these: 

- [img](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)
- [figure](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figure.asp)
- [figcaption](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp)

Hey that was all pretty techincal, I want some opinions: 

- [Using Figure & figcaption](http://html5doctor.com/the-figure-figcaption-elements/)

**Discussion**:

- `img` tag
- `figure` and `figcaption` tags

**Challenge 2**: Marking up images. The example shows an image with a caption. 

## Exercise 3 - Forms and Form Elements

Forms are super important, you are sure you're going to use a lot of them! Forms interface people, people enter their valuable data into your forms. Your forms better be good or you won't be collecting the data that will make your projects great! 

The input tags is the most common element used inside forms.

`<input>`

Attributes are really important, they are probably most at work on form elements. Read this article about the [Input Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp). Read the attributes section and look for: `for`, `type`, `placeholder` and `value`. 

**Challenge 3**: Markup the form. 

You need to mark up the form in `challenge-3.html`

- Forms
  - What kind of elements are in forms: 
    - form 
      - Attributes: 
    - input (has many types)
    - select
    - textarea
  - Using Labels 
  
## Code Review! 

How do you know when you're doing it right? I know you know you are doing it right, the problem is that there is some disagrement on what is right. 

Luckily  we have the [Validator](https://validator.w3.org)! The HTML Validator will look at your code and determin how right it is! 

Code review your completed form with another student. Look for and comment on these things: 

- Formatting
  - consistency
  - indentation
  - white space
- errors and syntax
  - does it validate? 
  - do you see any problems? 
    - `for` and `id` attributes used correctly
    - `type` attrubte use correctly
    - `placeholder` attribute used 
  - is everything there? 
    - all of the form elements have been addressed

## After Class

- Continue working on your current [tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/we-sell-shoes) 
- Review the work of another student. When you're done with the tutorial find another student and code review their work.
