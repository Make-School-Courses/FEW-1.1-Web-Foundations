## Initial Exercise

- CSS Flex Box

## Overview/TT I 

- Intro to Flex Box
  - What is it, what is it used for?
  - Flex parent, and flex items

## In Class Activity: [Example-1](example-1)

Use Flexbox to build a "card" that describes a video game character. 

The "card" is made up of several pieces. 

- Image
- Title
- Power
- R.O.F.
- Health

Arrange these items with FlexBox.

- flex-direction
- justify-content
- align-items

The goal is to explore the properties above and see their effects in the browser. 

## In Class Activity: [Example-2](example-2)

This example is like the first but has more than one item. Use FlexBox on the parent element along with FlexBox on the children in each card. 

- Use flex-wrap
- Use flex-box on more than one element to create a more complex layout

## In Class Challenge [Challenge 1](challenge-1)

You've been hired to work on a new app that gets people to go out for lunch more often. It needs a tip calculator. Your job is to build the tip calculator. 

The design team has provided a mock-up.

  - There may be child elements with a different Axis
- Apply a base font to the Body Tag
